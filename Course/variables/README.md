# Java Variables

Think back to that time you were in math class in middle school and just starting to learn algebra.
The teacher started throwing in letters into those equations and stuff and you were like, "How the heck do you add a plus b?".

Well variables in code are a lot like those variables in algebra. They are there as a placeholder to represent something else.
But in the case of code, the variables you can create are not limited to just a number.

Variables are able store different types of data. A data type is how the compiler recognizes the information stored in a variable. For example, data types are like saying water is a liquid, oxygen is a gas, and a rock is a solid, it describes the data.
