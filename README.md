## Getting Started

To get started with Free Java Bootcamp, here is a list of basic prerequisites you need:

  - A Computer (preferably with a OSx or Linux Operating System)
  - Very basic understanding of computers
  - Know how to navigate around your computer
  - Basic typing skills
  - Know how to search using Google (or another search engine of your choice)
  - Basic algebra skills (to understand variables, sets/arrays, and operations)
  
**If you do not have these skills, please take some time to brush up on them before you start to learn any programming language. Even if you are not looking to become a software engineer who writes intensely complicated algorithms, you need these basic skills to solve problems and be resourceful.**

If you do have these basic prerequisites, then lets get into setting up your computer with the necessary requirements to write and deploy your Java code.

### Set Up
---

#### Command Line

The command line is a programmers fort. This is where programmers navigate their computer's files, download programs, run servers, and run their code. 

Becoming familiar with where your terminal is and how to get around it would benefit you greatly in becoming a good programmer as well as getting through this course.

We will not be doing a complete tutorial on command line, but you will find helpful hints in the lessons that will show you the needed commands to run.

Here is a list of command line tutorials if you want to take some time to familiarize yourself with it:

  - [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line)
  - [Learn Enough To Be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial)
  - [Learn Command Line The Hard Way](https://learncodethehardway.org/unix/)
  - [LifeHacker](http://lifehacker.com/5633909/who-needs-a-mouse-learn-to-use-the-command-line-for-almost-anything)
  - ^Pick one, no need to do them all you just need a primer
  
#### Git

Git is a version controll system, one of many, but the most popular. 

Assuming since your on GitHub for this course, you already have git installed. But to assume makes an ass(outa)u(and)me.

So download [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) if you have not already done so.

#### Text Editor

A text editor is an application where you will actually write your code.

There are plenty of great editors out there. Some programmers use a terminal based editor called `vi` or `vim`. As a beginner, there is no need to stress yourself out over learning how to use `vim`. The learning curve is steep but provides quick functionality with key commands that (when learned) allows programmers to rely less on the mouse/trackpad which offers speed. If you want to learn `vim` you can go [here](http://vim-adventures.com/). Otherwise we are suggesting in this course you use a text editor like [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) which are free and easier to use.

I personally use Atom.

[Download Atom](https://atom.io/)

#### Java

Obviously if this is a course in Java we are going to need the tools to actually run Java code.

So to do this, first we need the Java Development Kit or JDK. This allows us to compile our code.

[Click here to download the JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)

You will select `Accept License Agreement`

Then you will download the product for the type of operating system you have.

[Click here to find out what operating system you have.](http://support.hubris.net/knowledge_base/006.php)

Next, we will need to be able to run our code after we can compile it. We can do this with the Java Runtime Environment or JRE. 

[Click here to download the JRE](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html)

Again, You will select `Accept License Agreement`

Then you will download the product for the type of operating system you have.

#### Download The Course

Now that you have the basic environment set up, we can now download the course to get started.

First you need to "Fork" this repository. You can do this by clicking on the for button on the top right hand corner of this page.
